# Yelp-Review-Analysis
## Overview:

Welcome to the Restaurant Review Analysis project! This project aims to assist aspiring restaurant owners and investors in making informed decisions about where to open a new restaurant. By leveraging data analysis techniques, we dive into restaurant reviews, perform thorough cleaning and processing, apply machine learning, and visualize key insights.

## Tools and Technologies Used:

- **Jupyter Notebook:** The primary environment for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization in Python.
- **Python Libraries:**
  - **scikit-learn (sklearn):** Used for implementing the Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning algorithm.
  - **matplotlib and seaborn:** Employed for creating insightful visualizations.
  - **pandas and numpy:** Essential for data manipulation and analysis.

## Project Structure:

1. **Data Cleaning:** The Jupyter Notebook script ensures the dataset is pristine, addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We delve into the dataset, exploring trends, sentiments, and popular cuisines to guide decision-making.
3. **Machine Learning:** The SVM algorithm is applied to provide predictive insights and identify key factors influencing restaurant success.
4. **Visualization:** Matplotlib and seaborn generate clear visual representations of our findings, making complex data more accessible.

## How to Use:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed.
   - Install required libraries using: `pip install <module-name>`

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Open `Zomato.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Execute cells step by step for a comprehensive understanding of the analysis.

3. **Explore Visualizations:**
   - Check the `Visualizations` folder for graphical representations of key insights.
